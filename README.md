ECSE 420: Parallel Computing

Submission instructions: Students are to work in groups of two on the assignment.

Each group should submit a pdf file that contains the following information: students’ names, students’ IDs, instructions on how to run each file and the associated question solved. Students are also expected to submit a .zip file containing their source code. This code must compile and run without error. Sample codes are provided for Questions 1&amp;3; students just need to modify these sample codes. The code must be well formatted, commented, and follow the Google Java Style Guide. For more information, see the ECSE420AssignmentSubmissionInstructions.pdf in the Assignment section on myCourses.

Questions

1.1. Modify the following method in the sample code to Implement a matrix multiplication sequentially:

public static double[][] sequentialMultiplyMatrix(double[][] a, double[][] b) Explain how you validate the method produces the correct results.

1.2. Modify the following method in the sample code to Implement a matrix multiplication in parallel: public static double[][] parallelMultiplyMatrix(double[][] a, double[][] b)

Explain the parallel tasks defined in your code and how their results are combined to produce the correct results. Explain how you validate the method works correctly.

1.3. Add a method to the source code that measures the execution time for both sequential and parallel matrix multiplication.

1.4. Vary the number of threads being used by the parallel method for matrix sizes of 2000 by 2000 and plot the execution time as a function of the number of threads.

1.5. Vary the size of the matrices being multiplied as (100 by 100, 200 by 200, 500 by 500, 1000 by 1000, 2000 by 2000, 3000 by 3000, 4000 by 4000) and plot the execution time as a function of matrix size for both parallel and sequential methods in one figure. Use the number of threads for which the parallel execution time in 1.4 is minimum.

1.6. For the generated graphs in 1.4 and 1.5 comment on their shape and possible reasons for the observed behavior.

2.1. Explain under what conditions deadlock could occur and comment on its possible consequences.

2.2. Discuss possible design solutions to avoid deadlock.

3.1. Modify the class public class DiningPhilosophers in the sample code to simulate the behavior of the philosophers for any number n of them, where each philosopher is a thread, and the chopsticks are shared objects. Notice that you must prevent a situation where two philosophers hold the same chopstick at the same time. Notice that in this program philosophers should be eventually deadlocked.

3.2. Amend your program so that it never reaches a state where philosophers are deadlocked, that is, it is never the case that each philosopher holds one chop- stick and is stuck waiting for another to get the second chopstick. Explain your solution to avoid deadlock.

3.3. Amend your program so that no philosopher ever starves. Explain your solution to avoid starvation.

4.1. Suppose the sequential part of a program accounts for 40% of the program’s execution time on a single processor. Find a limit for the overall speedup that can be achieved by running the program on an n-processor machine.

4.2. Now suppose the sequential part accounts for 30% of the program’s computation time. Let sn be the program’s speedup on n processors, assuming the rest of the program is perfectly parallelizable. Your supervisor tells you to double this speedup: the revised program should have speedup s′n &gt; sn*2. You advertise for a programmer to replace the sequential part with an improved version that decreases the sequential time percentage by a factor of k. What value of k should you require?

4.3. Suppose the sequential time percentage could be decreased 3-fold, and when we do so, the modified program takes half the time of the original on n processors. What fraction of the overall execution time did the sequential part account for? Express your answer as a function of n.
